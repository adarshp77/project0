I've created a webpage about myself. In the first webpage "index.html", you can see 3 other
links that will direct you to different parts of the website. Those links are formatted in a grid like structure.

In "goals.html", you'll see an ordered list on what I wish to accomplish in the near future. In "interests.html", I've 
created a table that shows my interests for 3 different categories. And finally, in "pictures.html", I've put in pictures that 
gives you a general idea on the things that I like. 

I've also created a css file called "guide.css" which styles different parts of the previously mentioned .html files. 
I've also created a sass file called "h1.scss" which changes the color of the main header on each web page.
